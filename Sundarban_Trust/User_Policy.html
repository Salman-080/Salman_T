<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
Sridate Pty Ltd, trading as the National Zoo & Aquarium (collectively referred to as “we”, “us” and NZA) recognises that your privacy is important to you and we are committed to protecting the Personal Information we collect about you. The NZA manages Personal Information in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APP) contained therein. This policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage Personal Information about you.

 

<h1>Purpose of collection</h1>
We may collect and use your Personal Information for one or more of the following reasons:

Providing our products or services to you
To assist with your queries
Processing a booking or application that you have made
Providing you with information about other services that may be of interest to you that we and other affiliated organisations may offer
Providing you with promotional information about us and other affiliated organisations
For surveys, direct marketing, promotions or competitions
Facilitating our internal business operations, including the fulfilment of any legal requirements; and analysing our services and customer needs with a view to developing new and/or improved services
 

<h1>Methods of collection</h1>
Personal Information will generally be collected directly from you through the use of any of our standard forms, over the internet, via email or through a telephone conversation with you. There may, however, be some instances where Personal Information about you will be collected from third party contractors or agents who provide our products and services on our behalf because it is impractical to collect Personal Information directly from you.

 

<h1>Types of information collected</h1>
The types of Personal Information about you that we collect include your name, address, contact details and other such information that can identify you and that is relevant for us to provide our products and service to you in the manner that you have requested, or to comply with the law.

 

We do not generally collect sensitive information from you such as details of your race, political beliefs or religion, however if you provide such information to us, we will only collect that information with your express consent and only where such information is reasonably required in order for us to provide our products or services to you (such as special access or assistance requirements due to a health condition). We shall not disclose sensitive information to any other party without your consent.

 

<h1>Failure to provide information</h1>
If the Personal Information you provide to us is incomplete and/or inaccurate, or you choose not to provide us with the Personal Information that we have requested, it may affect our ability to provide you, or someone else you know, with the products and services you or they are seeking.

If, upon receiving access to your Personal Information, or at any other time, you believe that Personal Information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date, please notify us immediately and we will take all reasonable steps to correct the information unless we are authorised not to do so by law.
